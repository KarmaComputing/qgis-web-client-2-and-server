QGIS requires both a client and server.

There are two well-known clients: 

1. A desktop version which must be installed like a traditional application.
2. A web based client, the most recent one being a modern 'react' based one.

There is one QGIS server implementation (implementing [web map service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service) and [Web Feature Services (WFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service).
